edit /etc/monit/monitrc:

locate `set alert` , copy and substitute with an email address where the monit
notification have to been sent.

For multiple notify recipient, just multiply this settings options:
set alert addr1@host.tld
set alert addr2@host2.tld

set mailserver 127.0.0.1

I also recommend to set the `set daemon` option (the monit's monitoring polling
cycle interval) to a lower value, between 30s-60s.
